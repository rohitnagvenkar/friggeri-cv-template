The letter was created by Matthew Davis, based on Adrien Friggeri's code

Matthew downloaded the code from latextemplates.com, who got it from Adrien Friggeri.
The copy at latextemplates.com has conflicting licensing agreements.
See the discussion here: https://github.com/mlda065/friggeri-letter/issues/2
I (Matthew Davis) am assuming that the BY-NC-SA 3.0 license was inappropriately added by latextemplates.com.
I am removing that license and leaving what I believe to be the original license, which is MIT.
