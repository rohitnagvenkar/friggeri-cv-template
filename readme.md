# friggeri-cv-template

This is a LaTeX template for a cover letter to go with a resume created with the [friggeri-cv resume template](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv).

A twist (redesign) to the template created by (https://github.com/mlda065/friggeri-letter)

I have posted only the changes that have been made by me, more information at (https://github.com/mlda065/friggeri-letter/blob/master/README.md).

## The letter

This letter class uses the same eye catching header as the Friggeri CV, and uses the Roboto font.

## Usage
* I am using TeXworks to edit and create these latex files, (http://www.tug.org/texworks/), use whichever software that suits you.

* Install the fonts.
(For Windows 10 users)
  1. Copy the fonts from friggeri-letter-master /fonts folder.
  2. Open up the run window using WinKey + R, type in fonts, which will lead to the opening up of the fonts folder.
  3. Paste the copied fonts inside that folder.
  
* Have the `.cls` file(s) in the same folder as your `.tex` file(s). (There's probably a way to install them properly. I don't know what that is.)

* Start with the example `.tex` file(s) and modify them to suit your needs.

* This template needs to be compiled with XeLaTeX
